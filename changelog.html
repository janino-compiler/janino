    <h4>Version 3.1.8 2022-09-01</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Generation of the StackMapTable is finally correct! However, the default tar version is still 6.</li>

      <li>Allow variable declarators between the LV declaration and the IF statement iff none of the VDs modify the LV.</li>
      <li>Added "-Xverify:all" to all run configuration to enforce the strictest bytecode verification possible.</li>
      <li>Test case "JlsTest.test_9_7_1__Normal_Annotations2()" choked because of annotation-type element value (annotation type is described by an UTF8 CPE, not a CLASS CPE).</li>
      <li>Fixed issue #167 "After a successful compilation, compiling identical (or similar) code fails with an assignment conversion error".</li>
      <li>Moved the "getArrayIClass(...)" methods from "IClass" to "IClassLoader", and keep the array classes per-class-loader (which is important because arrays refer to java.lang.Object). Also added a test case.</li>
      <li>Removed JUnit launch configurations for Java 12, 15 and 16, which are no longer supported.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 3.1.7 2022-04-19</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Merged PR #148 "Correct the logic to truncate Stack map in CodeContext.restoreLocalVariables".</li>
      <li>Merged PR #163 "Add SUPER flag for package member types only (#163)".</li>

      <li>Fixed Issue #155 "Enhanced FOR statement does not work with primitive variable".</li>
      <li>Verified compatibility with Java 17.</li>
      <li>Began to extend IClass and ClassFile for generics; specifically added IType and ITypeVariable. However generics are not yet supported; work in progress (although regression tested).</li>
      <li>Implemented private interface methods (a Java 9 feature).</li>
      <li>Further simplified the org.codehaus.commons.compiler.jdk.SimpleCompiler: It now uses a delegate o.c.c.c.j.Compiler, which saves a lot of duplicate code.</li>
      <li>Major refactoring of org.codehaus.commons.compiler.jdk to get rid of duplicate code.</li>
      <li>Fixed the error handling of the o.c.c.c.jdk.(Compiler|SimpleCompiler); added respective test cases.</li>
      <li>Marking the SimpleCompiler as "cooked" was not reliable.</li>
      <li>Static and default interface methods were still declared as "not implemented" on the home page, while they are already implemented! Updated the home page, added some test cases and fixed a minor bug.</li>
      <li>Added a test for the "diamond operator".</li>
      <li>Removed all "redundant type arguments", i.e. made use of the "diamond operator". This became possible because support was dropped for Java 6.</li>
      <li>Also dropped support for "funny" intermediate Java versions 9 and 10.</li>
      <li>Dropped support for Java 6. Thus, Janino is now compiled against the JRE 7 runtime.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 3.1.6 2021-07-28</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed issue #151: Calcite tests fail with compiler error</li>
      <li>Added a test case that reproduces issue #151.</li>
      <li>#141 Class loader workaround so that Calcite doesn't need to change. (#150)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 3.1.4 2021-05-06</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed issue #146: Local variables are wrongly trimmed in a stack</li>
      <li>Fixed issue #145: NaN comparisons are handled incorrectly</li>
      <li>
        Fixed issue #144: Can't parse a < b in some case: Made the parser modal: "a < b, c > d" is an expression list
        in some contexts (array initializer, method invocation), and a variable declaration in others (block
        statement).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed issue #141: Unable to find org.codehaus.commons.compiler.properties in java 11: ICompilerFactories were
        loaded through the current thread's "context class loader", which is a bad choice in some environments. Thus,
        the methods "getDefaultCompilerFactory()", "getAllCompilerFactories()" and "getCompilerFactory(className)"
        were duplicated and augmented with a "classLoader" parameter.
      </li>      
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 3.1.3 2021-01-25</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Issue #136: New BSD License?
        <br />
        janino-parent/pom.xml:
        <ul>
          <li>Changed license name from "New BSD License" to "BSD-3-Clause", because https://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Licenses recommends "... Using an SPDX identifier as the license name...".</li>
          <li>Changed license URL from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janino-compiler/janino/master/LICENSE.txt" to "https://spdx.org.licenses/BSD-3-Clause.html", because the latter is probably the most reliable and stable copy. (We are already using the SPDX identifier, see above, so it appears reasonable to link to the SPDX web site.)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Generating MethodInfos:
        Don't include thrown exceptions that are parameterized, e.g.
	    "void meth() throws EX {...}",
        because we don't generate "Signature" attributes for methods, and "throws Throwable"
        would cause compilation problems when the class is loaded later, e.g. by ClassFileIClass.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed one StackMap-related NPE.</li>
      <li>Issue #135: AssertionError for SimpleCompiler.cook when using DeepCopier</li>
      <li>More StackMap-related fixes.</li>
      <li>
        Fixed issue #129:
        Script evaluating does not work for java 11 when there is annotation processor (#130)
      </li>
      <li>
        Bump junit from 4.12 to 4.13.1 in /janino-parent (#134)
        <br />
        Bump ant from 1.7.1 to 1.9.15 in /janino (#132)
      </li>
      <li>
        Integrated Pull request #130:
        Fixed issue #129:
        Script evaluating does not work for java 11 when there is annotation processor
      </li>
      <li>Janino's default source version is now 11, and the default target version is 6.</li>
      <li>
        Fixed issue #131: Janino 3.1.2 is 10x slower than 3.0.11:
        The Compiler's IClassLoader was initialized way too eagerly,
        thus lots of classes were loaded from the class path, which is very slow.
      </li>
      <li>
        The default source version was not processed correctly; now it is derived from the system property
        "java.specification.version" ("Java Runtime Environment specification version").
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed "org.codehaus.commons.compiler.tests.EvaluatorTest.testAnonymousFieldInitializedByCapture()"
        test case.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed issue #69: Invocation of static interface method.</li>
      <li>
        Stack map computation is now complete, but the generated StackMapTable attributes is still buggy.
        Thus the default target version is still 6, so that the attribute is *not* written.
        The test case for issue now succeeds, thanks to this new feature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stack map generation is now working; however the saved StackMapTable attribute is still buggy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changed the return type of "IScriptEvaluator.createFastEvaluator()" from "Object" to "T".
        (This does not break binary compatibility, because "T" eventually compiles to "Object".)
      </li>
      <li>Issue #124: Janino Sandbox, JVisualVM cannot connect to the application</li>
      <li>
        Added "ICookable.setSourceVersion()" and "ICookable.setTargetVersion()" in order to implement JAVAC's "-source"
        and "-target" command line options.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 3.1.2, 2020-03-18</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed Issue #119 -- there was an ASSERT statement with a side effect.</li>
      <li>Merged PR #117 which successfully fixes issue #116.</li>
      <li>Reproduced issue #116 with new test "JlsTest.test_15_25__Conditional_operator__2()".</li>
      <li>Upgraded TXT2HTML version from 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT to 1.0.0.</li>
      <li>
        Improved the encoding of stack map frames according to JVMS11 4.7.4: Previously, only "full_frame"s were
        generated.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 3.1.1, 2020-03-09</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Merged pull request #114 "Grow the code for relocatables, and do fixup, and relocate".</li>

      <li>
        FINALLY is no longer implemented with JSR-RET. (Java 6+ .class files forbid JSR and RET). Another step towards
        Java 7+ .class files!
      </li>

      <li>
        Got rid of "CodeContext.flowAnalysis()" (approx. 500 LOC!), who's sole purpose was to compute the .class files'
        "maxStack" attribute - we now get that through the computed stack maps.
      </li>

      <li>Added support for JDISASM option "printAllOffsets".</li>

      <li>Enable generation of "StackMapTable" attribute by default.</li>

      <li>Major rewrite of UnitCompiler and CodeContext to implement the generation of the StackMapTable attribute.</li>

      <li>Upgraded JANINO JAVADOC from 8 to 11. Beautified the ASCII art in "overview.html".</li>

      <li>
        Fixed issue #107: Janino requires "org.codehaus.commons.compiler.io", but commons-compiler does not export this
        package
        <br />
        Yes, that package was missing from the exports list, plus several more.
      </li>

      <li>
        Added the concept of the "LocatableResource" declaring "getResource()", which simplifies the interfacing with
        "ClassLoader".
      </li>

      <li>
        Minor refactoring: Moved the methods "setParentClassLoader()", "setDebuggingInformation()" and
        "set(Error|Warning)Handler()" from "ICookable" to "ISimpleCompiler", "IClassBodyEvaluator", "IScriptEvaluator"
        and "IExpressionEvaluator", where they belong.
      </li>

      <li>Throw an NYI CompileException when a static interface method is invoked.</li>

      <li>Fixed "testIssue69_IncompatibleClassChangeError_when_evaluating_against_janino9plus()".</li>

      <li>Make DISASSEMBLER options configurable through system properties.</li>

      <li>When a method was compiled and then stored in a ClassFile, then the "variableArity" flag was lost.</li>

      <li>Renamed all "@Nullable optionalXyz" variables, fields and parameters to "@Nullable xyz" for consistency.</li>

      <li>
        Big rewrite of the ExpressionEvaluator - ScriptEvaluator - ClassBodyEvaluator - SimpleCompiler - Cookable
        hierarchy:
        <br />
        Previously, these classes EXTENDED from left to right, which was always a bit awkward: Actually an
        ExpressionEvaluator IS NOT a ScriptEvaluator (asf.).
        To clean up that mess, the classes now DELEGATE instead of EXTENDING: ExpressionEvaluator now HAS a
        ScriptEvaluator (asf.). This works much better than the old model, and is so much cleaner.
        <br />
        Strictly speaking, this is an INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE. However I am very sure that nobody ever (intentionally)
        RELIES on the old class hierarchy, e.g. assigns an ExpressionEvaluator object to a ScriptEvaluator variable.
        <br />
        Also, the "trick" to NOT load the generated classes immediately, but process them differently (the
        "ExpressionCompiler") now works differently... need to update the documentation to accomodate for this.
        <br />
        The methods "org.codehaus.commons.compiler.ISimpleCompiler.setPermissions(Permissions permissions)" and
        "...setNoPermissions()" were removed and replaced with the "org.codehaus.commons.compiler.Sandbox".
      </li>

      <li>
        The concept of the "ExpressionCompiler" was completely refactored: Instead of EXTENDING the
        "ExpressionEvaluater" in order to keep it from loading the generated bytecode, the ExpressionEvaluator now has
        a "getBytecodes()" method, and there is no more for an "ExpressionCompiler" class.
      </li>

      <li>Bug in "testAnyType()": An ExpressionvEvaluator must be cooked at most ONCE.</li>

      <li>Fixed the promotion of the array access index expression (see JLS7 15.13 Array Access Expressions).</li>

      <li>Fixed issue #108: Improve Sandbox</li>

      <li>Fixed issue #104: ClassLoaderIClassLoader 's ClassNotFoundException handle mechanism enhancement</li>

      <li>Refactored class "TeeReader" to method "Readers.teeReader()".</li>

      <li>Path to JAVAC executable is no longer hard-coded in "janino-parent/pom.xml".</li>

      <li>Added test case for issue #102.</li>

      <li>Eliminated the mis-named package "org.codehaus.commons.io".</li>

      <li>Moved the two remaining classes of package "org.codehaus.commons.io" to "org.codehaus.commons.compiler.io" resp. ".util" for consistency.</li>

      <li>
        Fixed issue #101: Using ResourceBundles with Java Class in SQL Database
        <br />
        Removed the support for "ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)" again - delegation is better than inheritance.
        <br />
        Added "setResourceFinder(ResourceFinder)" to support "ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream(String)".
        <br />
        Added test cases.
      </li>

      <li>
        Renamed "setEncoding(Charset)" to "setSourceCharset(Charset)", and leave the old method delegating to the new.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 3.1.0, 2019-08-14</h4>
    <p>
      In this release, many classes were moved from module <code>janino</code> to module <code>commons-compiler</code>,
      thus their package declarations changed.
      The "important" APIs, however, remain unchanged. All in all, it was decided to release this as a "minor" release.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Moved some test which are implementation-independent from "org.codehaus.janino" to "org.codehaus.commons-tests".
      </li>
      <li>
        Continued work on "jdk.Compiler". Thus moved lots of code from "janino" to "commons-compiler", and also the
        CompilerTests.
      </li>
      <li>
        Removed the (previously deprecated) "JaninoRuntimeException"; moved the "InternalCompilerException" from 
        "janino" to "commons-compiler".
      </li>
      <li>
        Added a test that illustrates issue #98 "Is there a convenient way to compile multi class form different
        package?".
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 3.0.16, 2020-03-18 (the 3.0.x line is deprecated)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fixed Issue #119 -- there was an ASSERT statement with a side effect.

        The syntax elements that can have modifiers now all have sets of "is...()" methods that check for each
        modifier. Some also have methods "getAccess()" and/or "getAnnotations()".

      </li>
      <li>Implemented parsing (but not compilation) of "modular compilation units" (JLS11 7.3).</li>
      <li>
        Simplified the debug configuration; instead of "-D disasm=true" use "-D

      <li>Added test cases for Java modifiers.</li>
      <li>
        Replaced all "assert...Uncookable(..., Pattern messageRegex)" and "assert...Uncookable(..., String

      <li>
        Minor refactoring: Allowed modifiers are now checked in the Parser, not in Java.*. This saves a lot of THROWS

      <li>
        Major refactoring: Access modifiers (public, static, ...) and annotations now exist in a proper type hierarchy;

        The <code>?:</code> operator no longer issues an error when the MHS is not assignable from the RHS and vice

    <ul>
      <li>Added version information to the <code>META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</code> file of the JANINO JARs.</li>
      <li>
        Added <code>CompilerFactoryFactory.getSpecificationVersion()</code> and
        <code>ICompilerFactory.getImplementationVersion()</code>.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed up the handling of debug options - added "ICookable.setDebuggingInfo(source, lines, vars)".</li>
      <li>Gave up on "EnumeratorSet" and "DebuggingInfo" - these mimic Java 5 ENUMs and were ugly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 2.6.0, May 30, 2010 - <a href="http://janino.unkrig.de/download/janino-2.6.0.zip">Download</a></h4>
    This version implements a number of incompatible changes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>CompileException</code> was moved from package <code>org.codehaus.janino</code> to package
        <code>org.codehaus.commons.compiler</code> (and so were its buddies <code>Location</code>,
        <code>LocatedException</code> and <code>CausedException</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>ParseException</code> and <code>ScanException</code> were removed; all methods that previously threw
        one or more of <code>CompileException</code>, <code>ParseException</code> and <code>ScanException</code> now
        throw only <code>CompileException</code>. (This is an API simplification honoring the fact that applications
        rarely want to differentiate between scan, parse and compilation problems).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The core functionality of JANINO (expression evaluator, script evaluator, class body evaluator, simple compiler
      and Java source class loader) was extracted to new interfaces declared in the new package
      <code>org.codehaus.commons.compiler</code>, while the original API remains unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      A second implementation of the <code>org.codehaus.commons.compiler</code> interfaces was added, based on the
      <code>javax.tools.JavaCompiler</code> API that exists since JDK 1.6. This implementation is available in the
      <code>commons-compiler-jdk.jar</code> file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather than instantiating e.g. <code>org.codehaus.janino.ExpressionEvaluator</code> directly, applications can now
      alternatively call
      <code>org.codehaus.commons.compiler.CompilerFactoryFactory.getDefaultCompilerFactory().newExpressionEvaluator()</code>,
      which will use the first implementation of <code>IExpressionEvaluator</code> on the class path (be it
      <code>janino.jar</code> or <code>commons-compiler-jdk.jar</code>, or yet another implementation).
    </p>
    <p>
      The JUNIT regression test suite was restructured so that if differentiates between implementation-independent tests,
      which are automatically executed against every implementation on the class path, and implementation-specific tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the following bugs were fixed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>JANINO-143: java.lang.ClassFormatError: Duplicate method name&amp;signature in class file Transformer1$1$1</li>
      <li>JANINO-146: Cannot compile on Java 1.6/6 if extended class does not implement an existing bridge method</li>
    </ul>

      <li>
        Optimized the handling of string concatenation: For sequences of 4 and more operands,
        the "new StringBuffer(a).append(b).append(c).append(d).toString()" is now used. (For
        two or three operands, "a.concat(b).concat(c)" is used as before.) Also, if
        "java.lang.StringBuilder" (the unsynchronized brother of "StringBuffer") is available
        (since JDK 1.5), it is used. See Tom Gibara's excellent
        <a href="http://today.java.net/pub/a/today/2007/02/15/tackling-performance-problems-with-janino.html">article

    <ul>
      <li>
        Extended <code>ExpressionEvaluator</code> and <code>ScriptEvaluator</code> with the capability to compile more
        than one expression/script in one evaluator. This greatly improves the runtime performance and reduces the JVM
        resource usage if you need to compile many expressions/scripts at the same time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Introduced the concept of "auxiliary classes". This allows you to specify individual classes that the
        expression/script/class body/compilation unit may access although they are not loadable through the
        <code>ClassLoader</code> that was set with <code>setParentClassLoader()</code>. In other words: The
        expression/script/class body/compilation unit executes in a "sandbox", restricted by a <code>ClassLoader</code>
        with minimal peepholes to the classes you specify. This also resolves issue JANINO-66: Security: restrict
        package access

      <li>Simplified the self-compile test.</li>
      <li>Cleaned up and simplified the local variables used by the TRY statement.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Replaced <code>TunnelException</code> with <code>ClassNotFoundException(Throwable ex)</code>, which makes
        exception handling much clearer. In retrospect, <code>TunnelExeption</code> has proven to be a bad concept.
      </li>
      <li>Made the last missing fields of <code>Java.Xxx</code> PUBLIC for AST manipulation.</li>
      <li>JANINO-57: Switch statment compiles space inefficiently for a large case span.</li>
      <li>JANINO-58: Janino issues "Error: For update is unreachable" where JAVAC keeps compiling</li>
      <li>JANINO-59: Patch to stop reporting extra errors</li>
      <li>JANINO-60: StackOverflowError when a local class is used</li>

      <li>Added the "default imports" feature to all <code>*Evaluator</code>s.</li>
      <li>
        <code>Scanner.close()</code> and all file-related <code>Scanner</code> constructors are now deprecated, because
        (A) they sometimes left input files open and (B) the logic was confusing - it is now strictly the caller's
        responsibility to open and close input files.
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete refactoring of the <code>*Evaluator</code> and the <code>SimpleCompiler</code> classes. <b>Important
        notice:</b> <code>ScriptEvaluator.evaluate()</code> had to be renamed to
        <code>ScriptEvaluator.getClazz()</code> due to a method signature clash with
        <code>ExpressionEvaluator.evaluate()</code>.
      </li>
      <li>Improved the JAVADOC of the <code>*Evaluator</code> and the <code>SimpleComplier</code> classes.</li>
      <li>JANINO-53: Java.NewClassInstance.toString() does not include arguments</li>
      <li>JANINO-54: Code missed out after "if (true) return;"</li>
      <li>JANINO-55: Nested array initializers no longer work in 2.4.2</li>

      <li>Added some tests to <code>JaninoTests</code> for class instance creation (basically JLS2 section 15.9.1).</li>
      <li>
        The <code>Scanner</code> now warns about misplaced DOC comments -- hence we need to have a
        <code>WarningHandler</code> installed also on the <code>Scanner</code>.
      </li>
      <li>Inner classes loaded from <code>.class</code> files could not be instantiated.</li>
      <li>JANINO-45: Add Parser.getScanner()</li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Major redesign of the <code>Java</code> class hierarchy -- basically the "uplink" of the AST objects is no
        longer set by a constructor parameter, but by the constructor of the <i>superordinate</i> AST object. As a
        consequence, the creation order of AST objects is no longer top-down, but bottom-up. This makes code that
        creates an AST significantly shorter.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>UnitCompiler</code> is now context-free, i.e. it can resolve types, constant values etc.
        <i>without</i> compiling the unit. This is necessary for the upcoming <code>JGrep</code> utility (see below).
      </li>
      <li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Wow, version 1.0 finally made it. If you also feel that Janino 1.0 were a good reason to drink a glass of
        champagne, do not hesitate. (Maybe, as a sign of recognition, you could send me the open bottle and I'll drink
        it up ;-) My postal address is on janino.net)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.17, October 09, 2003 (not released)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Methods declared in interfaces of object were not found when invoked (reported by Fabrice Carnet 2003-10-07).
      </li>
      <li>
        java.lang.VerifyError when loading a class compiled by Janino which invokes a method of an interface with more
        than zero parameters (reported by Fabrice Carnet 2003-10-07).
      </li>
      <li>
        ExpressionEvaluator, ScriptEvaluator and ClassBodyEvaluator now have constructors that allow for the
        specification of class and/or method name (requested by Fabrice Carnet 2003-10-07).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.16, October 06, 2003 (not released)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Basically a complete rewrite of the IClass loading mechanism. This solves many problems related to using Janino
        with custom ClassLoaders (e.g. in J2EE environments). (Reported by Laurent Millet 2003-09-24.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.15, September 12, 2003</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "net.janino.*Evaluator" now have constructor variants that allow the specification of extended / implemented
        types. This allows for providing a base class that supplies static "helper functions" (e.g. "println()").
        (Requested by Till Brychcy 2003-09-10.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.14, July 27, 2003</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>"net.janino.Compiler" can now compile a set of source files with forward references (requested by Richard Lewis 2003-07-24).</li>
      <li>Documented the "import" feature of ScriptEvaluator and ExpressionEvaluator.</li>
      <li>"Outer.Inner" was not properly resolved within ambiguous names.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.13, July 6, 2003</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Rewrote the "ClassBodyEvaluator"; can now be instantiated.</li>
      <li>"ClassBodyEvaluator" can now generate a class that extends / implements classes / interfaces (Requested by Richard Lewis 2003-06-28).</li>
      <li>Cleaned up "EvaluatorBase"; eliminating code duplicated between the various "*Evaluator" classes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.12, June 4, 2003</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed up method invocation conversion (reported by Antony Miguel 2003-06-02).</li>
      <li>Fixed a problem with for/while/do loops with constant true conditions. (Reported by Antony Miguel 2003-06-02).</li>
      <li>Made tons of methods and classes PUBLIC, as proposed by Antony Miguel 2003-06-03.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.11, June 1, 2003</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented "synchronized" statement (requested by Antony Miguel 2003-05-22).</li>
      <li>
        Moved common functionality from "ExpressionEvaluator", "ScriptEvaluator" and "ClassBodyEvaluator" into a common
        base class "EvaluatorBase".
      </li>
      <li>
        The generated class files and the <a href="javadoc/net/janino/IClassLoader.html"><code>IClassLoader</code></a>
        used to load classes defined outside the current compilation unit are now stored in thread-local globals. The
        <a href="javadoc/net/janino/IClassLoader.html"><CODE>IClassLoader</CODE></A> also holds the formerly global <a
        href="javadoc/net/janino/IClass.html"><CODE>IClass</CODE></A> cache, which caused a memory leak (reported by
        Fabrice Carnet 2003-05-20).
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="javadoc/net/janino/IClass.html#isAssignableFrom(net.janino.IClass)"><code>IClass.isAssignableFrom(net.janino.IClass)</code></a>
        did not handle primitive types (reported by Fabrice Carnet 2003-05-20).
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiple expressions, scripts and class bodies can now be loaded into the same <code>ClassLoader</code>, if
        that is a <a href="javadoc/net/janino/ByteArrayClassLoader.html"><CODE>ByteArrayClassLoader</CODE></A>. This is
        necessary if the expressions, scripts and classes need to refer to each other. (Requested by Fabirce Carnet
        2003-05-20.)
      </li>
      <li>
        A "for" statement with an empty condition (e.g. "for(;;)") caused a
        <code>java.lang.NullPointerException</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>net.janino.ClassLoaderIClassLoader.ReflectionIClass</code> holds a map that guarantees that
        <code>java.lang.Class</code>es and <a href="javadoc/net/janino/IClass.html"><CODE>IClass</CODE></A>es map
        one-to-one. This posed a memory leak. (Reported by Fabrice Carnet 2003-05-20.)
      </li>
      <li>Documented the <a href="javadoc/net/janino/ClassBodyEvaluator.html"><code>ClassBodyEvaluator</code></a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.10, April 22, 2003</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed up invocation of interface methods (reported by Reimond Bernstein 2003-04-14).</li>
      <li>Added references to types in same package, but different compilation unit.</li>
      <li>Fixed up C-style array variable declaration ("int a[] = ...") (reported by Reimond Bernstein 2003-04-14).</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.9, April 02, 2003</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added the "ClassBodyEvaluator" and the "ClassBodyDemo" class. These allow you to compile a "class body", i.e. a
        series of methods, variable declarations etc. (requested by Fabrice Carnet 2003-03-18).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed up "IClass.getArrayType()" which only worked for loaded classes, but not for classes in the current
        compilation unit.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>java.lang.ClassLoader</code> used to load the just-compiled class now uses as its parent the current
        thread's context class loader (reported by Fabrice Carnet 2003-03-26).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.8, March 05, 2003</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a bug in the flow analysis code (caused a compile-time error) (reported by Fu Li Chen 2003-02-21).</li>
      <li>
        "IClass" now uses "Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().loadClass()" instead of "Class.forName()"
        (feature requested by Dain Sundtrom 2002-02-16).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.7, November 26, 2002</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added "this" (reference to current instance). Added primitive class literals (e.g. "int.class"). Fixed several
        showstopper bugs. Added limited support for member classes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.6, November 22, 2002</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added reference comparison. Added ScriptEvaluator constructors that read from InputStream, Reader or Scanner.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.5, November 14, 2002</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Only the last import-on-demand directive in a compilation unit did work; using a class imported by an
        import-on-demand directive other than the last one caused a compilation error. (Reported by Audrius Meskauskas
        2002-11-14.)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.4, November 9, 2002</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Updated the overview page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.3, October 26, 2002</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Renamed "ExpressionTest" and "ScriptTest" to "...Demo". Fixed up several JAVADOC bugs. "ExpressionEvaluator"
        now has a "thrownExceptions" parameter. Added support for "void" type expressions to "ExpressionEvaluator".
        Added JAVADOC comments. Clean up. Fixed a bug in "AmbiguousName.reclassify()".
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.2, October 21, 2002</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixed a few more bugs reported by Jimmy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3.1, October 13, 2002</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Fixed an ArrayStoreException in ScriptEvaluator that was reported by Russell White 2002-06-25.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added reclassification of fully qualified type names: E.g. cast operation "(HashMap) xyz" did work, but
        "(java.util.HashMap) xyz" didn't. Reported by Jimmy 2002-10-13.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.3, May 25, 2002</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added most missing language elements that I planned to add. The JLS is now almost completely implemented,
        except for nested classes and interfaces.
      </li>
      <li>
        This is the first version of JANINO that I will "advertise". Let's see if anybody wants to use the tool...
        After all it's a 80 percent complete Java<sup>TM</sup> compiler in only 11000+ (well-documented) lines of
        code!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.2, April 28, 2002</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Almost a rewrite. Added several painfully missing language elements.</li>
      <li>Added more JAVADOC.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.1.1, November 09, 2001</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Added missing sample source files to the runtime package.</li>
      <li>Added <code>break</code> and <code>continue</code>.</li>
      <li>Added lots of JAVADOC comments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Version 0.1, October 30, 2001</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Initial release</li>
    </ul>
