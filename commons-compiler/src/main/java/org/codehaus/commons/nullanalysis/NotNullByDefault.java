/**
 * By default, types in method signatures that lack a null annotation are regarded as <em>nullable</em>.
 * This annotation (with it default value {@code true}) indicates that types in method signatures that lack a null
 * annotation are regarded as <em>non-null</em>.
 * It is generally good practice to add {@code @NotNullByDefault} to all your package declarations (i.e.
 * 'package-into.java' files), because in well-designed code (especially API methods), {@code @NonNull} is
 * significantly more frequent than {@code @Nullable}.
